# Simon

I am actually really excited, because this is appyling exactly to what I thought was going to be the most difficult thing and that was creating multiple user types and different pages for them. With the Simon example, I was able to see that I can just add a drop down and depending on the selection that the user picks (Landscaper or Homeowner) then it redirects them to the page that they need. I will need to keep looking into profiles and see how they store data but huge step forward!

Another thing that I am going to implement into my site is the little logo that they can put on the actual browser! 

During this css project with simon, I have been able to pick up on little things such as how to manipulate the entire page to make sure that everything is functional and aligned properly.

I am making sure that I am following the instructions, and the outline, and I am able to see what I am wanting to transfer over to my startup. 

I liked being able to work with the tabs and also show the active tab, which is definitley more user friendly when they are jumping back and forth. 

I like how it is very much so user based and user friendly and I think that is the thing that I am going to take away from this and place more of an emphasis in my design. Less complex, more focused on user.
