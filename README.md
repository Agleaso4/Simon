# Simon

I am actually really excited, because this is appyling exactly to what I thought was going to be the most difficult thing and that was creating multiple user types and different pages for them. With the Simon example, I was able to see that I can just add a drop down and depending on the selection that the user picks (Landscaper or Homeowner) then it redirects them to the page that they need. I will need to keep looking into profiles and see how they store data but huge step forward!

Another thing that I am going to implement into my site is the little logo that they can put on the actual browser!
